Welcome! I’m glad you stopped by.

Make yourself at home, but please, leave your shoes at the door; I’ve just had new carpets fitted.

**I’m Rebeca,** a freelance writer. From my little flat in Edinburgh, I produce sparkling copy for agencies and small businesses.   

**Before I set up my home office,** I worked for three years at a PR and digital marketing agency. I’ve developed impactful copy and campaigns for businesses across all sorts of industries, including:

<center>Education / Food and drink / Tourism / Public Sector / Construction</center>

<br>**When you work with me,** you can expect purposeful, reflective and responsibly written content. Phoning it in is not my style. **I want to deliver work that we can both be proud of.**

**Before I press send** on a writing project, I ask myself three questions.

- **Is it useful?** <br>Even the most beautifully written copy is useless if it doesn’t function as it should. I reflect on whether the work truly supports your goal. If not, it’s back to the old drawing board.

- **Is it simple?** <br>Although I adapt my tone and style to each brand, I aim for simplicity in all my writing. Why make customers wade through words to understand your message?

- **Does it sparkle?** <br>After a few rounds of edits, I go back in with my glitter pen to make sure the work isn’t just good; it’s extra special.

**I’d love to work with you.** Do you feel the same? Learn about the [services]({{ site.baseurl }}/freelance-writer-edinburgh ) I offer (and my competitive rates).

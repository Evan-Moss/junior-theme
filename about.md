Welcome! I’m glad you stopped by.

Make yourself at home; I’ll put the kettle on<span class = "asterisks">*</span>.

**I’m Rebeca,** a freelance writer. From my little flat in Edinburgh, I produce sparkling copy for agencies and small businesses.

**Before I set up my home office,** I worked for three years at a PR and digital marketing agency. I’ve developed impactful copy and campaigns for businesses across many industries, including:

<center>Education <strong>/</strong> Food and drink <strong>/</strong> Tourism <strong>/</strong> Public Sector <strong>/</strong> Construction</center><br>
**My content** helps your customers better connect with your business. I offer several **services**, including content for social media, websites and blogs.

**When you work with me,** you can expect purposeful, reflective and caringly written content. **I want to deliver work that we can both be proud of.**

**Before I press send** on a writing project, I ask myself three questions:

### Is it useful?

Even the most beautiful copy is useless if it doesn’t function as it should. I reflect on whether the work truly supports your goal. If not, it’s back to the old drawing board.

### Is it simple?

Whilst I adapt my tone and style to each brand, I aim for simplicity in all my writing. Why make customers wade through words to understand your message?

### Does it sparkle?

After a few rounds of edits, I go back in with my glitter pen to make sure the work isn’t just good; it’s extra special.

**I’d love to work with you.** Do you feel the same? Learn about the [services]({{ site.baseurl }}/freelance-writer-edinburgh ) I offer (and my competitive rates).
